# {ANDROID} TO-DO unnamed first version

- [ ] \(!) Detect and report all conflicts when trying to take a `Ramo`.
- [ ] \(!) Fix bug: app crashes mostly when deleting first `Ramo` at `HomeActivity`.
- [ ] Somehow, allow the user to easily and anonymously report an error and, if so, manage to get device data (model, manufacterer and Android version).
- [ ] Optimize landscape agenda (less views, less memory, etc.). Probably, convert it to a grid RecyclerView. Note: this will lead MAJOR changes in saving agenda as image feature.
- [ ] Improve export image icon a little (ingrease arrow border thickness).
