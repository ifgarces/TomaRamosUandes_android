# {ANDROID} TO-DO unnamed first version

- [ ] Maybe, also refactor: replace "agenda" by "schedule".
- [ ] `AgendaLanscapeFragment`:
  - [ ] Fix bug:  initialized more than once, consuming time.
  - [ ] Improve view adding a little white border for each block (like the Excel agenda).
  - [ ] Improve image exporting: before export, resize the target view to be larger (also enlarge text). Make that dimensions constant for all devices.
- [ ] Make demo video, in order to make the app accesible.
- [ ] Somehow, allow the user to easily and anonymously report an error and, if so, manage to get device data (model, manufacterer and Android version). Probably using Google Forms, in the frontend (`WebView`) or the backend (more complex).
